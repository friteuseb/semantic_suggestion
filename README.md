</details>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit your TypoScript setup to configure the extension:

```typoscript
plugin.tx_semanticsuggestion {
    settings {
        parentPageId = 1
        proximityThreshold = 0.7
        maxSuggestions = 3
        excerptLength = 150
        recursive = 1
        excludePages = 8,9,3456
        recencyWeight = 0.2

        analyzedFields {
            title = 1.5
            description = 1.0
            keywords = 2.0
            abstract = 1.2
            content = 1.0
        }
    }
}
```

### Weight System for Analyzed Fields

The `analyzedFields` section allows you to configure the importance of different content fields in the similarity calculation:

| Weight | Importance |
|--------|------------|
| 0.5    | Half as important as standard |
| 1.0    | Standard importance |
| 1.5    | 50% more important than standard |
| 2.0    | Twice as important as standard |
| 3.0+   | Significantly more important than standard |

<details>
<summary><strong>Configuration Parameters Explained</strong></summary>

- `parentPageId`: The ID of the parent page from which the analysis starts
- `proximityThreshold`: The minimum similarity threshold for displaying a suggestion (0.0 to 1.0)
- `maxSuggestions`: The maximum number of suggestions to display
- `excerptLength`: The maximum length of the text excerpt for each suggestion
- `recursive`: The search depth in the page tree (0 = only direct children)
- `excludePages`: Comma-separated list of page UIDs to exclude from analysis and suggestions
- `recencyWeight`: Weight of recency in similarity calculation (0-1) 
- `recencyWindow`: Number of days to consider for recency calculations (default: 30)
- `minRecencyDifference`: Minimum difference in days to apply recency boost (default: 1)
- `recencyDecayFactor`: Factor for logarithmic decay of recency importance (0.1 to 1.0, default: 0.5)

</details>

### The Weight of Recency in Similarity Calculation (0-1)

The `recencyWeight` parameter determines the importance of publication or modification date in similarity calculations:

- **0:** Recency has no impact
- **1:** Recency has maximum impact

<details>
<summary><strong>How Recency Weight Works</strong></summary>

1. Base similarity score is calculated from content
2. Recency boost is calculated based on publication/modification dates
3. Final similarity is a weighted combination of content similarity and recency boost

Formula:
```
finalSimilarity = (contentSimilarity * (1 - recencyWeight)) + (recencyBoost * recencyWeight)
```

Choosing the right value:
- Low (0.1-0.3): Slightly favor recent content
- Medium (0.4-0.6): Balance between content similarity and recency
- High (0.7-0.9): Strongly favor recent content

Consider your specific use case:
- News website: Higher recency weight
- Educational resource: Lower recency weight
- General blog: Medium recency weight
</details>


#### New Configuration Parameters

- `recencyWindow`: Number of days to consider for recency calculations (default: 30)
- `minRecencyDifference`: Minimum difference in days to apply recency boost (default: 1)
- `recencyDecayFactor`: Factor for logarithmic decay of recency importance (0.1 to 1.0, default: 0.5)

#### How the Advanced Recency Boost Works

1. **Time Window**: Only considers content changes within the specified `recencyWindow` (e.g., last 30 days).
2. **Minimum Difference**: Ignores tiny time differences less than `minRecencyDifference` to avoid insignificant boosts.
3. **Normalization**: Converts actual ages to a 0-1 scale within the recency window.
4. **Logarithmic Decay**: Applies a logarithmic function to give more weight to recent changes while reducing the impact of older ones.
5. **Configurable Decay**: Uses `recencyDecayFactor` to adjust the steepness of the decay curve.

#### Recency Boost Calculation Process

1. Calculate the age of each page in seconds.
2. If the age difference is less than `minRecencyDifference`, return 0 (no boost).
3. Normalize ages to 0-1 scale based on `recencyWindow`.
4. Apply logarithmic decay: `1 - (log(1 + normalizedAge * 9) / log(10)) * decayFactor`
5. Calculate the absolute difference between the decayed values of the two pages.

#### Formula

```
recencyBoost = abs((1 - (log(1 + normalizedAge1 * 9) / log(10)) * decayFactor) - 
                   (1 - (log(1 + normalizedAge2 * 9) / log(10)) * decayFactor))
```

Where:
- `normalizedAge` is the page age divided by `recencyWindow`, capped at 1
- `decayFactor` is the configured `recencyDecayFactor`

#### Advantages of this Approach

- **Meaningful Differences**: Ignores insignificant time differences.
- **Balanced Importance**: Gives more weight to recent content without overshadowing relevance.
- **Customizable**: Allows fine-tuning for different types of websites and content strategies.
- **Gradual Decay**: Provides a smooth transition in importance as content ages.

#### Configuring for Your Needs

- **News Site**: Use a shorter `recencyWindow` (e.g., 7 days) and higher `recencyDecayFactor` (e.g., 0.8)
- **Evergreen Content**: Use a longer `recencyWindow` (e.g., 90 days) and lower `recencyDecayFactor` (e.g., 0.3)
- **Balanced Approach**: Keep default values or slightly adjust based on content update frequency

By leveraging this advanced recency boost calculation, the Semantic Suggestion extension provides a nuanced and configurable way to balance content relevance with recency, suitable for a wide range of website types and content strategies.


## üñ• Usage


### In Fluid Templates

To add the plugin directly in your Fluid template, use:

```html
<f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath='lib.semantic_suggestion' />
```

This method uses the TypoScript configuration and is suitable for simple integrations.

### TypoScript Integration

You can also integrate the Semantic Suggestions plugin using TypoScript. Add the following TypoScript setup to your configuration:

```typoscript
lib.semantic_suggestion = USER
lib.semantic_suggestion {
    userFunc = TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Core\Bootstrap->run
    extensionName = SemanticSuggestion
    pluginName = Suggestions
    vendorName = TalanHdf
    controller = Suggestions
    action = list
}
```

Then, you can use it in your TypoScript template like this:

```typoscript
page.10 = < lib.semantic_suggestion
```

Or in specific content elements:

```typoscript
tt_content.semantic_suggestion = COA
tt_content.semantic_suggestion {
    10 = < lib.semantic_suggestion
}
```

Remember to include your TypoScript template in your site configuration or page setup.

## üéõ Backend Module

### Performance Metrics

![Backend module performance metrics](Documentation/Medias/backend_module_performance_metrics.png)
![Backend module performance metrics - No cache](Documentation/Medias/backend_module_performance_metrics_no_cache.png)

The backend module provides crucial performance metrics to help optimize the extension's operation:

<details>
<summary><strong>Execution Time (seconds)</strong></summary>

- **What**: Total time for semantic analysis, including page retrieval, calculations, and caching
- **Interpretation**: 
  - Lower is better
  - High values may indicate need for content structure optimization or increased caching
  - 0.00 seconds typically means results were cached
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Total Pages Analyzed</strong></summary>

- **What**: Number of pages included in the semantic analysis
- **Interpretation**: 
  - Depends on page tree structure and configured analysis depth
  - Higher numbers may increase accuracy but also execution time
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Similarity Calculations</strong></summary>

- **What**: Total number of page-to-page similarity comparisons
- **Calculation**: Typically `n * (n-1) / 2`, where `n` is the number of pages analyzed
- **Interpretation**: 
  - Higher numbers indicate more comprehensive analysis
  - May impact performance with large page sets
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Results from Cache</strong></summary>

- **What**: Indicates whether results were retrieved from cache (Yes/No)
- **Interpretation**: 
  - "Yes" means faster execution (cached results)
  - "No" indicates a fresh analysis was performed
  - Frequent "No" results might suggest too frequent cache clearing or rapidly changing content
</details>

#### Optimizing Performance

1. **Caching**: Adjust caching configuration to match your update frequency
2. **Analysis Depth**: Balance comprehensiveness with performance
3. **Excluded Pages**: Use `excludePages` setting to omit irrelevant pages
4. **Content Structure**: Organize content to minimize analyzed pages without compromising quality

Monitor these metrics to fine-tune the extension's configuration for your specific use case.

## üßÆ Similarity Logic

The extension employs a custom similarity calculation to determine related pages:

1. **Data Gathering**: Collects title, description, keywords, and content for each subpage of the specified parent page.
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Compares page pairs using a word intersection and union method. The similarity score is the ratio of common words to total unique words, weighted by field importance.
3. **Proximity Threshold**: Only pages with similarity scores above the configured threshold are considered related and displayed.
4. **Caching Scores**: Calculated scores are stored in `tx_semanticsuggestion_scores` table for performance optimization. These are updated periodically or when page content changes.

## üé® Display Customization

Customize the display of suggestions by overriding the Fluid template (List.html). Configure your own template paths in TypoScript:

```typoscript
plugin.tx_semanticsuggestion {
    view {
        templateRootPaths.10 = EXT:your_extension/Resources/Private/Templates/
    }
}
```
## Enhanced Semantic Analysis

Our latest update introduces several improvements to the semantic analysis process:

1. **Multi-lingual Support**: The system now handles stop words for multiple languages, improving the accuracy of analysis across different content languages.

2. **N-gram Analysis**: In addition to individual word analysis, we now use n-grams to capture phrases and improve context understanding.

3. **TF-IDF Scoring**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) has been implemented to better identify important terms within the context of your entire site.

4. **Recency Boost**: A configurable recency boost factor allows newer content to be given more weight in similarity calculations.

5. **Text Normalization**: Advanced text normalization techniques have been applied to improve comparison accuracy across different text formats and encodings.

6. **Levenshtein Distance**: Similar word detection using Levenshtein distance helps in identifying related content even with minor spelling variations.

These enhancements provide a more nuanced and accurate similarity analysis, leading to better content suggestions and improved semantic relationships between pages.


## üåê Multilingual Support

The extension fully supports TYPO3's multilingual structure, analyzing and suggesting pages in the current site language.
